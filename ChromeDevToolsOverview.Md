Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.

Check out the video for live demonstrations of core DevTools workflows, including debugging CSS, prototyping CSS, debugging JavaScript, and analyzing load performance.

Open DevTools 
There are many ways to open DevTools, because different users want quick access to different parts of the DevTools UI.

When you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).
When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to jump straight into the Console panel.
See Open Chrome DevTools for more details and workflows.
